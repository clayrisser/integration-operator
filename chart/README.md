| Created Event   | Created Event   | event triggered when plug or socket created                                                   |
| Updated Event   | Changed Event   | event triggered when plug or socket updated                                                   |
| Coupled Event   | Joined Event    | event triggered when applications connected                                                   |
| Decoupled Event | Detached Event  | event triggered when applications disconnected                                                |

## Architecture

### A simple analogy

The best way to explain the architecture is to think about how plugs and sockets work in the real world.

Let's say I have a laptop purchased in the United States. In order to power my laptop, I need to **integrate** it with the power grid.
Since the laptop was purchased in the United States, the **interface** of the **plug** is Type A as illustrated below.

![Type A](https://gitlab.com/bitspur/rock8s/integration-operator/-/raw/main/images/typea.png)

This means the **socket** I connect to must be also be Type A.

Now, let's say I travel to India and the only **socket** available to me is Type D as illustrated below.

![Type D](https://gitlab.com/bitspur/rock8s/integration-operator/-/raw/main/images/typed.png)

Since the **socket** interface does not match the **plug** interface, I cannot integrate my laptop with the power grid in India. Of course
this can be overcome with converters, but that is beyond the scope of this analogy.

### A real example

Let's say I have an express application that needs to **integrate** with a mongo database. The express deployment will have a **plug** with
a mongo **interface** and the mongo deployment will have a **socket** with a mongo **interface**. If the **interface** of the **socket** is
a postgres **interface** then the integration will fail. In other words, you cannot connect a mongo **plug** to a postgres **socket**. That
would be like trying to plug a US Type A **plug** into an Indian Type D **socket**. You can only connect a mongo **plug** to a mongo **socket**.
